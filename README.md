## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to my *Wealth of Nations* data analysis project! In this project, I explored global economic data, focusing on key indicators such as **GDP per capita**. The data was cleaned and transformed in **Excel**, and then visualised through an interactive **Tableau** dashboard.

I created **5 visuals**, ensuring the dashboard met **colour-blind accessibility** requirements. This project demonstrates how raw data can be turned into actionable insights! 👨‍💻📊
